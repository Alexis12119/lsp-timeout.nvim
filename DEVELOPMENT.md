## GIT WORKLOW & CONVENTIONS
* This project's history is going to be aggressively [force-pushed](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#Documentation/git-push.txt) and [squash-rebased](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) into a specific [semver] versions
* The said versions might be later revised, dropped or removed (unless specific package manager doesn't allow version replacement).
* This implies that any [upstream] commits pulled may become obsolete

#### Tags naming conventions:
* `latest` - latest released version
* `vX.Y.Z`  - version, per [semver]
* `nighlty` - testing build

#### Branch naming convention
* `main` - main dev branch
* `release/X.Y.Z` - next release; tightly coupled to `main`

[semver]: https://github.com/semver/semver 'Semantic version'
[upstream]: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#upstream 'Gighub glossary: upstream'

## BUILD
### Dev dependencies
* **[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)** - required for `make` command; should be already installed on *nix systems
* **[ts-vimdoc](https://github.com/ibhagwan/ts-vimdoc.nvim)** - the tool is used to generate `doc/*.txt` files from `*.md`
* **[LuaFormatter](https://github.com/Koihik/LuaFormatter)** - lua code formatter; much faster than `stylua`
